              I am a fifth year PhD student in economics at UC Berkeley. My
              fields are industrial organization, public economics and household
              finance. Before starting at my PhD, I was a research assistant in
              the Financial Structure section at the Federal Reserve Board for
              two years.

              “Regulation and Market Power: Evidence from the Manufactured
              Housing Industry”
            </p>
            <p>
              In this paper, I study the mortgage market for manufactured homes
              (also known as mobile homes) using loan-level Home Mortgage
              Disclosure Act data. I first document how post-crisis regulations
              like stress testing worsened market power issues in this market.
              Regulation raised costs for large banks relative to other lenders.
              Their total market share subsequently declined from about 25% to
              less than 5%, and prices increased for borrowers. Meanwhile, the
              largest nonbank firm in the market grew to have nearly a 40%
              national market share. I then study a second regulation that
              improved consumer welfare. In 2014 an interest rate restriction on
              the highest priced loans lowered interest rates with minimal
              impact on supply, increasing consumer welfare. I estimate consumer
              welfare using a logit demand model and will estimate
              counterfactual welfare under different interest rate restrictions.
