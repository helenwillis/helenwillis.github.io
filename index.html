              I am a fifth year PhD student in economics at UC Berkeley. My
              fields are industrial organization, public economics and household
              finance. Before starting at my PhD, I was a research assistant in
              the Financial Structure section at the Federal Reserve Board for
              two years.

              “Regulation and Market Power: Evidence from the Manufactured
              Housing Industry”
            </p>
            <p>
              In this paper, I study the mortgage market for manufactured homes
              (also known as mobile homes) using loan-level Home Mortgage
              Disclosure Act data. I first document how post-crisis regulations
              like stress testing worsened market power issues in this market.
              Regulation raised costs for large banks relative to other lenders.
              Their total market share subsequently declined from about 25% to
              less than 5%, and prices increased for borrowers. Meanwhile, the
              largest nonbank firm in the market grew to have nearly a 40%
              national market share. I then study a second regulation that
              improved consumer welfare. In 2014 an interest rate restriction on
              the highest priced loans lowered interest rates with minimal
              impact on supply, increasing consumer welfare. I estimate consumer
              welfare using a logit demand model and will estimate
              counterfactual welfare under different interest rate restrictions.

              “Mortgage Servicing and Household Financial Health” (with Manisha
              Padi and Chen Meng)
            </p>
            <p>
              Debt servicers directly interact with household borrowers, make
              key decisions about creditor leniency, and have been targeted to
              help alleviate financial distress by regulators during the 2008
              financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the 2013
              introduction of mortgage servicing regulations by the Consumer
              Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), we study whether requiring
              servicers to warn delinquent consumers and to process loss
              mitigation applications prior to foreclosure improves consumer
              outcomes. Data from loan level mortgage performance data shows
              that servicing regulations significantly improve loan performance,
              lowering the probability that a loan ends up in loss mitigation or
              in foreclosure. Moreover, using linked credit data, we show that
              servicer-driven, rather than household-driven, shifts in loan
              performance generate changes in households’ financial health.
              Overall, our results imply that servicer regulation has the
              potential to alleviate debt burdens in both crisis and non-crisis
              environments.
